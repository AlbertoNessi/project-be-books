# My book review service

## Framework + stack
Symfony + mysql

## Logic
The UI presents itself at first with a search bar in which the user can search for books.
The search calls the '/book/search' endpoint in my Symfony project that returns a list of books.

The user can select a book and add a review with:
- "review": "text"
- "score": 6
- maybe author, Publishing house, publiching year etc

The user can submit the review.
